    AMDGPU: Make various vector undefs legal

    Surprisingly these were getting legalized to something
    zero initialized.

    This fixes an infinite loop when combining some vector types.
    Also fixes zero initializing some undef values.

    SimplifyDemandedVectorElts / SimplifyDemandedBits are not checking
    for the legality of the output undefs they are replacing unused
    operations with. This resulted in turning vectors into undefs
    that were later re-legalized back into zero vectors.

    (cherry picked from commit 7a84624079a2656c684bed6100708544500c5a32)
